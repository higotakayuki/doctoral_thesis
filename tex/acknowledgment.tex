First, I would like to thank my supervisor, associate Prof. Keiki
Takadama for a lot of his support.
In 2003, I was inspired to start this research 
by his work,  an optimization method using reinforcement learning.
I also would like to thank 
Prof. Shigenobu Kobayashi,
Prof. Katumi Nitta,
Prof. Takao Terano,
Prof. Yoshiyuki Kabashima, and
assosicate Prof. Isao Ono
for reviewing this thesis and providing comments to make it
meaningful. 
This work was also supported by a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (54103)
and the 21st Century COE Program
``Creation of Agent-Based Social System Sciences,''
and I would like to thank the leader, Prof. Hiroshi Deguchi.

I wish to thank
the members of Takadama laboratory, 
Nitta laboratory, 
Watanabe laboratory, 
Kabashima laboratory,
the work group for next generation algorithms, etc.
They have encouraged and inspired me to
proceed my research through discussions on science,
engineering, human life and so on.
Especially, Prof. Sumio Watanabe,
who is my supervisor in my Bachelor course,
associate Prof. Yukito Iba,
Dr. Kazuho Watanabe, 
Takashi Sinzato and Masashi Sekino,
have had a strong impact on my attitude towards this research 
and I appreciate them.
Finally,
I wish to thank my parents, Toshiaki and Toshiko, and my brother,
Tomoyuki, for their support.
Needless to say, my friends are also essential 
to enjoy proceeding this study.
